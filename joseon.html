	<h1>
		Joseon
	</h1>
	
	<p>
		The Joseon dysnasty was founded in 1392 by Yi Seonggye(이승계), and it lasted for nearly 500 years, until it was 
		replaced by the Korean empire in 1897. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>
		Founding
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		In the late 14th century, while the power of the preceding kingdom, Goryeo, was waning from years of attacks, the royal 
		court of the kingdom split into 2 conflicting factions, one led by general Yi and the otehr by general Choe.  Yi, while <img src="./images/joseon_pagoda.jpg" alt="pagoda from Joseon" title="pagoda from Joseon" align="right" width="30%" heigth="50%">
		leading an attack on the liaodong peninsula, turned back and initiated a coup d'état in Gaegyeong, overthrowing king Woo.
		  He later killed both king Woo and his heir, taking his place on the throne.
	</p>
	
	<h2>
		Power struggles
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		Throughout the middle period of the Joseon dynasty, Korea faced many hardships, both internal and external.  Internally,
		a faction called the Sarim faction, gained control of the government while king Seonjo(선조) was in power.  The Sarim faction then split into 2 opposing
		factions called the Easterners and the Westerners, the former of which then split into 2 more factions called the southerners and northerners.
		In the 1600s the Westerners permenantly split into the Noron and Soron factions.  The alteration of power between these factions, led to charges of treason,
		purges and a vicious cycle of revenge.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 1590, Toyotomi Hideyashi, a prominent Japanese General and politician,
		invaded Korea, intending to use it as a stepping stone to try and invade China.  By using european firearms, and due to the internal squabbles of the Korean factions,
		Joseon's troops were overpowered and the Japanese occupied the south of the peninsula including seoul and pyongyang.<img src="./images/joseon_painting.jpg" alt="painting from Joseon" title="painting from Joseon" align="left" width="30%" heigth="50%">  The invasion
		was eventually slowed by Yi Sun-sin, an admiral, destroying the invasion fleet, as well as guerrilla combat to fight the ground troops.
	</p>
	
	<h2>
		Late Joseon
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		After invasion from the Japanese, Joseon experienced nearly 200 years of peace, and the emergence of Silhak(실크), or practical learning, which 
		advocated a reform of the taxation, science and agriculture, in the aim of rebuilding society after it had been devastated by attacks.
		Kim Yuk(김유욱), king Hyeonjong(현종)'s chief minister implemented the reforms proposed by the Silhak, which proved extremely beneficial
		to both the state and the commonfolk.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Later, the 2 kings, Yeongjo(영조) and Jeongjo(정조), would bring about a second renaissance of the Joseong dynasty, establishing a 
		royal library called Gyujanggak(규장각) which improved the country's cultural and political standing, and also establishing bold social
		initiatives, like opening government postitions to people of a lower class.  All these developements were fully supported by the Silhak,
		who during this time encouraged the people to reflect on state tradition and lifestyle and initiated studies of Korea's history, geography and language.
