		3 Kingdoms Period
	</h1>
	
	<p>
		The 3 kingdoms period refers to the kingdoms of Goguryeo(고구려), Baekje(백제), and Silla(신라) from 57 BCE to 668 AD.
		The 3 kingdoms controlled the entire peninsula as well as most of Manchuria, which is now in China/Russia. Baekje and 
		Silla occupied the South of Korea, while Goguryeo occupied the North.
	</p>
	
	
	<h2>
		Goguryeo
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		The Kingdom of Goguryeo is thought to have been the first, and most advanced of the 3 kingdoms to arise in Korea.<img src="./images/3_kindoms.png" alt="map of the 3 kingdoms" title="map of the 3 kingdoms" align="right" width="30%">
		According to Chinese records it arose in 75 BCE on the banks of the Yalu river.  Goguryeo would eventually become the 
		largest of the 3 kingdoms, and alternated between several capitals, including 2 in the Yalu area and Nangrang, which is now in pyongyang.
		The kingdom began on the broder of China and slowly expanded into Manchuria and southwards.
	</p>
	<p>
		Goguryeo was a very militarstic state, boasting a powerful empire, being able to overpower most of the other kingdoms in 
		Asia.  The kingdom reached it's peak in 500 AD under the rule of king Gwangaeto the Great(광개토) and his son, Jangsu(장수).
		For the next 100 years Goguryeo was the dominant kingdom in far East Asia up until it's collapse in 668 AD when it was taken
		over by Tang Dynasty China.
	</p>
	
	<h2>
		Baekje
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		Baekje was founded by 2 sons of the founder of Goguyeo who fled, after a conflict of successsion, around the seoul area 
		At the peak of it's rule, Baekje controlled the majority of the West of the Korean peninsula.  The kingdom also boasted
		an extremely powerful naval force, making it a major factor in the spread of Buddism throughout East Asia as well as bringing
		continental culture to Japan.<img src="./images/silla_statue.jpg" alt="sculpture from the kingdom of Silla" title="sculpture from the kingdom of Silla" align="left" width="30%" heigth="50%">
	</p>
	
	<h2>
		Silla
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		Silla was the smallest and weakest of the 3 kingdoms, instead relying on diplomacy to make pacts and alliances with the 
		more powerful kingdoms in Korea, and eventually also with China, allowing for it's survival. After anexing the Gaya confederacy, both Goguryeo and Baekje formed an alliance and began to attack Silla.  In order to cope with these attacks, Silla 
		managed to form an alliance with the Tang dynasty in China, using the yellow sea as a trade route direct to China. Eventually, Silla and the Tang dynasty managed to overthrow both Goguryeo and Baekje, then Silla forced the Tang troops occupying the
		South of the peninsula, with Silla then taking over Korea South of Pyongyang.  The capital then became Seorabeol and buddism became the official religion 528 AD.
